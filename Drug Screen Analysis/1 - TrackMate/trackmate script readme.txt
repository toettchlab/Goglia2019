in fiji, just click: File -> New -> Script	then open: "batch_trackmate.py"

then press "run"

it usually will throw an error (ignore this) and then a dialog box will open prompting you to select the file location
where you've saved your merged KTR/H2B files to be trackmated

it'll spit out one .txt file per merged KTR/H2B file (into the same folder)
